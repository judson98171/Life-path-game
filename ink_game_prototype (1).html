=== start ===
It’s two months before graduation. Your room is messy, papers scattered everywhere, and your phone keeps buzzing with messages from friends talking about their futures.

You sit at your desk, staring at your college application essay — the blank page reflecting your uncertainty.

What do you want to focus on?

+ [Push forward with college applications]
    -> college_apps
+ [Look for a job or internship]
    -> job_search
+ [Avoid the pressure for now]
    -> avoidance

=== college_apps ===
You decide to buckle down and work on your college applications.

A call from your counselor comes in.

Counselor: "Remember, this is your chance. You can do this, but you need to put in the work."

-> pressure += 10
-> fear += 5
-> growth += 5

You feel the pressure rising but also a flicker of hope.

~ goto reflection

=== job_search ===
You decide to look for a job or internship instead.

A friend texts you about an opening nearby.

Friend: "Hey, there’s this job opening you might like! Thought you should know."

-> growth += 10
-> pressure += 5
-> fear += 5

You feel excited but nervous about stepping into the unknown.

~ goto reflection

=== avoidance ===
You decide to put off thinking about all this for now.

Scrolling through social media, you see friends making plans.

A pang of loneliness and regret washes over you.

-> regret += 10
-> fear += 10
-> growth -= 5
-> loneliness += 10

You wonder if you’re falling behind.

~ goto reflection

=== reflection ===
You take a moment to think about your choices.

What’s on your mind?

+ [“Am I making the right choice for my future?”]
+ [“It’s scary, but I have to keep pushing.”]
+ [“Maybe there’s a path no one’s told me about.”]
+ [“Why do I feel so alone right now?”]
